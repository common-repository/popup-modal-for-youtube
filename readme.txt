Show Youtube Video in Popup Modal when posts/page loads.

== Description ==
This plugin lets you show youtube video in a popup modal when the post or page loads.
Just insert a url of the video for a specific post or page and it's done.
You can change the behaviour of the video like turning off the controls,autoplay etc.
You can even set the popup to fade out when the video has finished playing.

<b>Note:</b> For Live streaming videos you need to set the Auto close popup modal to "NO" since it does not have any specific end time or the popup will close automatically during streaming.
